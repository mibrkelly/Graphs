# Graphs
This is a small ongoing project that allows one to create their own graphs and do basic computations in graph theory.

Currently the graph begins with 5 nodes. The user can drag and drop nodes, connect nodes, remove edges, delete and add nodes and select graph components.

I plan to add the following functions:
-Compute the maximum and minimum degree of vertices
-Compute the connectivity (edge and vertex)
-Shortest path algorithms
-Find Euler and Hamilton cycles
-Find the chromatic number and generate colorings (edge and vertex)
-Others?
