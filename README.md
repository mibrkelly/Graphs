# Graphs
This is a small ongoing project that allows one to create their own graphs and do basic computations in graph theory.

Current functionality:
-Graph starts with 5 nodes and no edges
-Drag and drop nodes
-Click nodes to connect them
-Select connected components
-Add and delete nodes
-Computes the diameter of a component
-Computes whether or not the graph is Hamiltonian

I plan to add the following functions:
-Compute the maximum and minimum degree of vertices
-Compute the connectivity (edge and vertex)
-Shortest path algorithms
-Find Euler cycles
-Find the chromatic number and generate colorings (edge and vertex)
-Others?
