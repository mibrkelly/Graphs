# Graphs
This is a small ongoing project that allows one to create their own graphs and do basic computations in graph theory.

So far the graph includes 5 nodes and the user can move them, connect them and disconnect them. I plan to add the following functions:
-Add and delete nodes
-Compute the maximum and minimum degree of vertices
-Compute the connectivity (edge and vertex)
-Shortest path algorithms
-Find Euler and Hamilton cycles
-Find the chromatic number and generate colorings (edge and vertex)
-Others?
